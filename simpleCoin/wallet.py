"""This is going to be your wallet. Here you can do several things:
- Generate a new address (public and private key). You are going
to use this address (public key) to send or receive any transactions. You can
have as many addresses as you wish, but keep in mind that if you
lose its credential data, you will not be able to retrieve it.

- Send coins to another address
- Retrieve the entire blockchain and check your balance

If this is your first time using this script don't forget to generate
a new address and edit miner config file with it (only if you are
going to mine).

Timestamp in hashed message. When you send your transaction it will be received
by several nodes. If any node mine a block, your transaction will get added to the
blockchain but other nodes still will have it pending. If any node see that your
transaction with same timestamp was added, they should remove it from the
node_pending_transactions list to avoid it get processed more than 1 time.
