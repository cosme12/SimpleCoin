## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` or the current branch version. 
2. If you've added code make sure to test it (no problem if it doesn't work at first commit though).
3. Keep pull requests small and aim to solve a simple problem. Make many pull requests if problems are different.
4. If you think your pull request is big, you can always start a new issue to discuss it together.

## Issues  
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Important

The idea of this project is to build a **really simple** blockchain system, so make sure all your code is easy to read (avoid too much code in 1 line) and don't introduce complex updates if they are not critical. In other words, keep it simple.

Thanks for helping and don't be scared to contribute.
